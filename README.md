# NoteKeeper
ANDROID App - A simple app to take and store notes for courses you are taking.

One of my son's is currently attending college and wanted a simple way to take a quick note. 
While he still uses paper, this app was developed to meet his requirements, allowing for a
quick note and allowing him to specify the specific course.
